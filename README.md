One of the key projects in this repository is the **Assignment 3 - Pokedex**. This project involves creating a simple Pokedex application that interacts with the PokeAPI to fetch and display information about different Pokemon.

### Purpose
The purpose of the Pokedex project is to demonstrate the integration of Java with external APIs, handling JSON data, and building a graphical user interface using JavaFX.

### How It Works
